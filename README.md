# realtime-emotion-detection
A computer vision application that recognizes and outputs up to 7 classes of facial emotions in realtime!

The dataset I used for this project can be found on Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/msambare/fer2013. Please note that I used a reduced version of the training dataset.
